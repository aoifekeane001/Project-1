## Project Name 
TBD

## Project Description
Purpose of this project is to X 

## Project Scope
### In Scope
Data: 
* Drug Overdose Deaths data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/drug-overdose-deaths)

Project Requirements: 
1. x 
2. x
3. x 
4. x

### Out of Scope
Data: 
* Any other data set not listed in scope of this document

Project Requirements: 
* Any requirement not listed in scope of this document

## Objectives
* x
* x

## Assumptions
* Correct data set used for the project
* Measuring system is accurate and precise

## Approach 
Process Steps to analyse the data in order to meet project requirements:
* Data Collection 
* Data Preparation 
* Data Exploration /Data Visualisation 
* Results Interpretation

Types of data analysis in orde to meet project requirements:
* Descriptive Analysis
* Data Reprocessing
* Data Visualisation

Use Python libraries:
* NumPy: supports n-dimensional arrays and provides numerical computing tools - useful for Linear algebra and Fourier transform
* Pandas: to handle missing data, manipulate the data, perform mathematical operations
* Matplotlib: to add data visualisation (e.g. graphs, charts, histograms, plots)

## Initial Data Research & Summary
Details to be added
